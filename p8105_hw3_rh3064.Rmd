## Data Loading

```{r}
accel_data <- read_csv("./Data/accel_data.csv")
```

## Data Tidying/Wrangling

The following chunk of code cleans the column names with `janitor::clean_names()`, then using `mutate()` creates a new variable *day_type* which indicates if it was a weekend or weekday. Finally `relocate()` is used to reorder the tibble so that more useful columns are first (*day_id*, *week*, *day*, *day_type*).

```{r}
accel_data <- 
  accel_data %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(
    day_type = case_when(day == "Saturday" | day == "Sunday" ~ "Weekend",
                         TRUE ~ "Weekday")
    ) %>%
  relocate(day_id, week, day, day_type)
```
